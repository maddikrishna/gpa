Project Overview
This project is a Python-based GPA calculator designed specifically for students of Krishna University College of Engineering and Technology. Since the university does not officially provide GPA calculations, this tool was developed to fill that gap and help students determine their GPA based on their semester marks.
Objective
The primary goal of this project is to provide an accurate and automated method for students to compute their GPA as per the university's academic regulations. The tool ensures that students can easily input their subject-wise marks and receive their calculated GPA instantly.
Key Features
     •	Supports multiple academic regulations, including R20 and R23.
     •	Includes semester-wise course details and corresponding credit points.
     •	Accepts student marks as input and assigns grades based on predefined grading criteria.
     •	Calculates GPA by weighting grades according to course credit values.
     •	Alerts students if they have failed a subject, preventing GPA calculation for that semester.
     •	Provides a user-friendly and interactive experience through command-line prompts.
How It Works
    1)	The user selects the applicable regulation (R20 or R23).
    2)	The user then selects the academic year and semester.
    3)	The program prompts the user to enter marks for each subject.
    4)	If the student has failed any subject (marks below 40), GPA calculation is not performed.
    5)	If all subjects are passed, the GPA is calculated using the formula:
 	GPA = ∑(Grade × Course Credit) / ∑(Total Credits)
    6)	The final GPA is displayed to the user.

Conclusion
This GPA calculator provides a simple yet effective way for students to determine their academic performance. By automating the GPA calculation process, it eliminates manual errors and ensures accuracy while saving time for students.
